# system-call
This is adding two system call into custom Linux kernel. <br>
At first, need to download a custom Linux kernel into your computer, but I delete the link, so I will post the link when I find it. <br>
The file create two system calls called `array_stats` and `process_ancestors`

### Note, since we adding two ssytem calls into real kernel, if computer is not good, it may take a really long time to compile, so plan your time.
